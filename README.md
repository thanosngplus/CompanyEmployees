# Company And Employees Tracker API

## Description
A REST API for an application that tracks company information, and their employees.

## "Why?"
Long story short: **Because it's fun!**

However, short story long...
1. Started with [the foundations of C# by Microsoft](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/foundational-c-sharp-with-microsoft/). 
2. I loved what I saw, and immediately bought [C# Player's Guide](https://csharpplayersguide.com/) after a strong recommendation from a friend.
3. I followed the official .NET Core web API and MVC guides from Microsoft, made some small mock projects to get the basic gist, but they felt simple.

Wanting to dive deeper in the world of .NET I decided to follow best practices for my next project.
This is the combined result of books, StackOverflow, Discord asking, and lots of googling.
