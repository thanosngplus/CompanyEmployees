# Company And Employees Tracker API

## Description
A REST API for an application that tracks company information, and their employees.

## "Why?"
My work experience comprised of Python and TypeScript, and I was interested to see how the world of .NET and C# is.

But, short story long...
First thing I did was [go through the foundations of C# by Microsoft](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/foundational-c-sharp-with-microsoft/). 
I loved what I saw, and immediately bought [C# Player's Guide](https://csharpplayersguide.com/) after a strong recommendation from a friend.
After going through most of the projects, I followed the official .NET Core web API and MVC guides from Microsoft, made some small mock project, but it felt simple.
Wanting to dive deeper in the world of .NET I decided to "overengineer" the next project. 

This is the combined result of book reading, stackoverflow, Discord asking, and lots of googling. Because why not?
